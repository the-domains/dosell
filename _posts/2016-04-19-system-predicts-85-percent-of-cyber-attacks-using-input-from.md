description: "Today's security systems usually fall into one of two categories: human or machine. So-called \"analyst-driven solutions\" rely on rules created by living experts and therefore miss any attacks that don't match the rules. Meanwhile, today's machine-learning approaches rely on \"anomaly detection,\" which tends to trigger false positives that both create distrust of the system and end up having to be investigated by humans, anyway."

<article style=""><h1>System predicts 85 percent of cyber-attacks using input from human experts</h1><p>Today's security systems usually fall into one of two categories: human or machine. So-called "analyst-driven solutions" rely on rules created by living experts and therefore miss any attacks that don't match the rules. Meanwhile, today's machine-learning approaches rely on "anomaly detection," which tends to trigger false positives that both create distrust of the system and end up having to be investigated by humans, anyway.</p><img src="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/og/public/images/2016/AI2-CSAIL.jpg" /></article>
