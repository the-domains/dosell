  The insecure implementation of the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)
  protocol, an Oasis standard for IoT communication, by many IoT product vendors
  is contributing to the high risk of IoT devices on enterprise and home
  networks. Although TLS is recommended by the Cloud Security Alliance for
  secure communication with MQTT, most vendors appear to ignore transport
  security, making all communication open and available.
