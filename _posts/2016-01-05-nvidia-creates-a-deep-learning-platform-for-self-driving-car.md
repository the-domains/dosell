description: "The self-driving car is a huge computational problem. It's so tough that traditional computer vision techniques don't work tackling it. So Nvidia has turned to an artificial intelligence technique, dubbed deep learning, to train brain-like computers that can learn how to identify hazards on a road and safely direct a self-driving car."
