description: 'This eSeminar shows how easily a simulation can be created and integrated in the overall design process. Integrating simulation upfront in the design stage, greatly reducing the overall time to market through providing better first past designs. Using guidance from seasoned experts or implementing simulation templates, more robust and optimized design can be created from the beginning.'
