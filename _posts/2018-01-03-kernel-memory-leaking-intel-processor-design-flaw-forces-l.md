  A fundamental design flaw in Intel's processor chips has forced a significant
  redesign of the Linux and Windows kernels to defang the chip-level security
  bug. Programmers are scrambling to overhaul the open-source Linux kernel's
  virtual memory system, while Microsoft is expected to publicly introduce
  necessary changes to its Windows operating system in this month's Patch
  Tuesday.
