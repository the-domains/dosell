  In the guide, you'll find articles organized by six major stages in the
  hardware development lifecycle: R&D (Research and Development), Plan, Design,
  Fabricate, Assemble, and Test. These stages are not always linear, and most
  often cyclical-teams move between and through these stages until a product is
  fully refined.
