  The world is on the brink of the fourth industrial revolution, and it could
  change the way we use everything from cars to shoes. The first three
  industrial revolutions brought us mechanisation, mass production and
  automation. Now, more than half a century after the first robots worked on
  production lines, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are
  shaking things up again.
