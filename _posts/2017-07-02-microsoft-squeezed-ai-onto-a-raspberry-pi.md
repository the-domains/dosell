  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning usually work best with a lot of
  horsepower behind them to crunch the data, compute possibilities and instantly
  come up with better solutions. That's why most AI systems rely on local
  sensors to gather input, while more powerful hardware in the cloud manages all
  the heavy lifting of output.
