"I do not see a way forward without
software liability," said Jeff Moss aka Dark Tangent. As software eats the
world, industries which are already subject to liability are becoming software
companies: Moss called Airbus, Boeing, and Tesla manufacturers of "moving data
centers." The recent Jeep hack highlights the extent to which vehicle
manufacturers have become software companies, and vulnerable to software flaws.

In 2016, 4 million new "things"
will become available to consumers, according to Gartner. From a security
standpoint, we could be talking about 4 million digital door keys to private
homes.

Every unsecured IoT device can
act as an entry point to your household as well as your online assets.
Intruders can even use the Internet of Things to open your front door from the
inside --- literally. While the trend grows unabated, more consumers are starting
to worry about what a fully connected home means for their security and
privacy.

"The IoT brings network,
application, mobile, and cloud technologies together in a unique ecosystem but,
unfortunately, it seems to acquire the nastiest security traits of each, " says
Bogdan Botezatu, Senior E-Threat Analyst at Bitdefender.

Here are the six most common
weaknesses to look for when considering buying a new IoT device:

The latest ST33-based TPM relies on
the advanced ARM 32-bit SC300(tm) SecurCore(r) microcontroller. Along with its
embedded TPM firmware, it provides a TCG compliant toolbox for
security-sensitive services such as platform integrity checks or secure
personal data storage. The **ST33TPM12LPC has received security certification
based on the certified TPM protection profile (Revision 116) with Common
Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4+**. This ensures that the product
totally meets TCG certification requirements and is now listed as Certified TPM
by the TCG organization.

'The
Internet of Things (IoT) is moving from a centralized structure to a complex
network of decentralized smart devices. This shift promises entirely new
services and business opportunities. An increasingly connected world will see
the growing networking and cloud-enablement of all sorts of physical devices
from machines through cars to home appliances. It is even transforming
manufacturing as we move towards the fourth "industrial revolution".
Accelerated by initiatives such as the German Government's Industrie 4.0
(industrial internet) project, this stage of industrial development will see
the emergence of smart factories powered and secured by smart semiconductor
solutions capable of sharing information and optimizing processes across the
entire value chain.

Security
matters: The IoT is built on many different semiconductor technologies,
including power management devices, sensors and microprocessors. Performance
and security requirements vary considerably from one application to another.
One thing is constant, however. And that is the fact that the success of smart
homes, connected cars and Industrie 4.0 factories hinges on user confidence in
robust, easy-to-use, fail-safe security capabilities. The greater the volume of
sensitive data we transfer over the IoT, the greater the risk of data and
identity theft, device manipulation, data falsification, IP theft and even
server/network manipulation.

Ensuring security in software, Gary McGraw
has long argued, means starting at the code level: That is, build security in
from the start. McGraw, chief technology officer at Cigital Inc. and recognized
as the industry's foremost software security expert, has said that enterprises
too often focus on repairing damage post-breach and fixing bugs after launch.
Instead, he argues, greater attention to security in the earliest stages of
software development would greatly reduce the percentage of successful attacks,
and minimize damage when malicious hackers do succeed.

1\. Common  Criteria is a standard about Information Technology Security
Evaluation, which, is true to its name Commonly **accepted
all over the World, in 25 countries. **

[][13]****

2\. The standard defines a construct of creating
the system of the product security, in an implementation-independent
structure called Protection Profile, or in an implementation-dependent
structure called Security Target, giving the possibility to create a truly
**product-fitting security requirement construct. **

****

3\. The security requirements are set up in a
system based on the assets of the product, and the threats to be countered,
taking into consideration the security policies and assumptions, **satisfying the security objectives**, thus producing an effective security system.

********

4\. If the requirements cannot be chosen from the
predefined set, there is a possibility and a defined method to create entirely
new requirements.

5\. The product is made more secure during the evaluation process, which **helps the
developers with the observations by evaluation experts**. 

****

6\. There are 7 predefined evaluation depths
called Evaluation Assurance Levels, and a possibility to create new ones,
giving the chance to conduct the evaluation method best fit for the needs of
developers or customers.

7\. The evaluated and certified products can be  compared by the customers.

****

8\. The customer recognition of the certified
product is higher, because the evaluation and certification experts are trusted by the consumers.

****

9\. There are **many tenders where the customers
ask for a Common Criteria Certificate of the product. .**

> During the ICCC 2015 conference, both the EU
> and NATO backed up Common Criteria, stating that the CC Certifications played
> and will play a significant role in the procurements of the associations.

********

10\. There are already **more than 2500 certified products**, from a wide range,
proving that the certificate can be achieved 

****

**Scope of the Common Criteria **

On the
commoncritariaportal.org the product-scope of the CC contains the following categories:

* Access
Control Devices and Systems
* Biometric
Systems and Devices 
* Boundary
Protection Devices and Systems
* Data
Protection
* Databases
*
