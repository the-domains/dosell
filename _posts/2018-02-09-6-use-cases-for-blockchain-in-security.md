  Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed electronic ledger built on the
  model of offering absolute security and trust. Using cryptography,
  transactions are recorded chronologically and publicly, each one time-stamped
  and linked to the previous one. Critically, these digital 'blocks' can only be
  updated through the consensus of all participants, with data interception,
  modification and deletion near impossible.
