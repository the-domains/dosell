### Common Criteria Laboratory of Hungary

The goals of Common Criteria are twofold:

1\. To allow a method for the customers to specify the security requirements of products according to their needs and in a standardized way, so that the manufacturers and developers are able to specify and develop the products according to the requirements, conformant to the customer needs.

2\. To enable the development of mutually recognized secure product categories, which are accepted all around the world.

The certifications according to these requirement frameworks are an assurance that the certified products resist against the threats and are also functionally trustworthy. The standard assesses the aim of the product, the physical and logical environment, and gives a standardized approach to define security requirements (functional, assurance and environmental). This approach is based on the security objectives (assumptions, policies and the analysis of threats). The aim of the certification is to prove that the product conforms to the requirements.The geographical scope is split according to the certification-capability of the participant states.

There are Certificate Providers (Australia, Canada, India, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States) and Certificate Consumers (Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Singapore, Israel, Pakistan, India)
