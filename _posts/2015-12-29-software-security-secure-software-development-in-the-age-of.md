> The IoT is the Internet of Easy
> Home Hacking by venturebeat ([read it][2])

In 2016, 4 million new "things" will become available
to consumers, according to Gartner. From a security standpoint, we could be
talking about 4 million digital door keys to private homes.

Every unsecured IoT device can
act as an entry point to your household as well as your online assets.
Intruders can even use the Internet of Things to open your front door from the
inside --- literally. While the trend grows unabated, more consumers are starting
to worry about what a fully connected home means for their security and
privacy.

Here are the six most common
weaknesses to look for when considering buying a new IoT device:[link][2]

They don't all have the same security standards." (Timo Grassmann, Product

The latest ST33-based TPM relies on
the advanced ARM 32-bit SC300(tm) SecurCore(r) microcontroller. Along with its
embedded TPM firmware, it provides a TCG compliant toolbox for
security-sensitive services such as platform integrity checks or secure
personal data storage. The ST33TPM12LPC has received security certification
based on the certified TPM protection profile (Revision 116) with Common
Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4+. This ensures that the product
totally meets TCG certification requirements and is now listed as Certified TPM
by the TCG organization. ([link to datasheet][2])

'The
Internet of Things (IoT) is moving from a centralized structure to a complex
network of decentralized smart devices. This shift promises entirely new
services and business opportunities. An increasingly connected world will see
the growing networking and cloud-enablement of all sorts of physical devices
from machines through cars to home appliances. It is even transforming
manufacturing as we move towards the fourth "industrial revolution".
Accelerated by initiatives such as the German Government's Industrie 4.0
(industrial internet) project, this stage of industrial development will see
the emergence of smart factories powered and secured by smart semiconductor
solutions capable of sharing information and optimizing processes across the
entire value chain.

# **Secure Software development approach**

> Build Your Software Securely ([webinar][2])

> The Ten Best Practices for Secure
> Software Development ([pdf][2])

"In the 80's we wired the world with
cables and in the 90's we wired the world with computer networks. Today we are
wiring the world with applications (software). Having a skilled professional
capable of designing, developing and deploying secure software is now critical
to this evolving world." - Mark Curphey, Director & Product Unit Manager,
Microsoft Corporation, Founder of Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

1\. Protect the Brand Your Customers
Trust

2\. Know Your Business and Support it
with Secure Solutions

3\. Understand the Technology of the
Software

4\. Ensure Compliance to Governance,
Regulations, and Privacy

5\. Know the Basic Tenets of Software
Security

6\. Ensure the Protection of Sensitive
Information

7\. Design Software with Secure
Features

8\. Develop Software with Secure
Features

9\. Deploy Software with Secure
Features

10\. Educate Yourself and Others on
How to Build Secure Software

> How to develop software the secure,
> Gary McGraw way ([read the blog][2])

Ensuring security in software, Gary
McGraw has long argued, means starting at the code level: That is, build
security in from the start. McGraw, chief technology officer at Cigital Inc.
and recognized as the industry's foremost software security expert, has said
that enterprises too often focus on repairing damage post-breach and fixing
bugs after launch. Instead, he argues, greater attention to security in the
earliest stages of software development would greatly reduce the percentage of
successful attacks, and minimize damage when malicious hackers do succeed.

> Why is the CC recommended for the developers? ([CC portal][3])

1\. Common  Criteria is a standard about Information
Technology Security Evaluation, which, is true to its name Commonly **accepted all over the World, in 25 countries.**

2\. The standard defines a construct of creating
the system of the **product security**, in an
implementation-independent structure called Protection Profile, or in an
implementation-dependent structure called Security Target, giving the
possibility to create a truly product-fitting security requirement construct.

3\. The security requirements are set up in a
system based on the assets of the product, and the threats to be countered,
taking into consideration the security policies and assumptions, satisfying the security objectives, thus producing an **effective security system**.

4\. If the requirements cannot be chosen from the
predefined set, there is a possibility and a defined method to create entirely
new requirements.

5\. The product is made more secure during the evaluation process, which helps the
developers with the observations by evaluation experts.

6\. There are **7 predefined evaluation depths
called Evaluation Assurance **Levels, and a possibility to create new ones,
giving the chance to conduct the evaluation method best fit for the needs of
developers or customers.

7\. The evaluated and certified products **can be  compared by the customers**

8\. **The customer recognition of the certified
product is higher**, because the evaluation and certification experts are trusted by the consumers.

9\. There are **many tenders ****where the customers
ask for a Common Criteria Certificate of the product.**

> **During the ICCC 2015 conference, both the EU
> and NATO backed up Common Criteria, stating that the CC Certifications played
> and will play a significant role in the procurements of the associations.**

10\. There are already **more than 2500 certified products,** from a wide range,
proving that the certificate can be achieved.

****

commoncritariaportal.org the product-scope of the CC contains the following
