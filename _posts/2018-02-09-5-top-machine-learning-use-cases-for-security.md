  At its simplest level, machine learning is defined as "the ability (for
  computers) to learn without being explicitly programmed." Using mathematical
  techniques across huge datasets, machine learning algorithms essentially build
  models of behaviors and use those models as a basis for making future
  predictions based on newly input data.
