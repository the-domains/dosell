  More than 5 billion IoT devices were installed in 2015. Gartner estimates this
  will grow to 20 billion by 2020. Unfortunately, experts agree that security is
  not only an afterthought, but often is actively resisted and circumvented. IoT
  devices are attractive to hackers because they have very weak login
  credentials, are "on 24/7" and have little to no secure communication
  channels.
