description: 'The four-day event, which kicked off on Sunday, has the slogan "Gated Communities" - symbolizing limitations on transparency and free speech in the digital word. The organizers want to point out that users view the world as filtered by Google, Youtube, Facebook - and therefore see only part of the world.'
