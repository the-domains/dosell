  This guide demonstrates how existing IoT solutions can be adapted to address
  more complex problems (e.g., solutions that require more sensor monitoring).
  The solution we present here, an Environment Monitor, incorporates additional
  hardware and extends the use of IoT software libraries (sensors and I/O).
