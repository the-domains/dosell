description: "Picture a startup in the middle of hyper-growth. It's adding engineers to keep up, but because its team is outgrowing the limited process it has in place, its product release cadence starts to slow. It's taking longer to check-in and deploy code. Features - then entire products - stop making it all the way to customers."
