description: 'In 2015, roughly 35%-40% of new cars shipped in the US were connected to the internet, far surpassing our 23% estimate from the beginning of the year. We expect this strong growth to continue through 2016, and estimate that twothirds of new cars shipped in the US will be connected to the internet.'
