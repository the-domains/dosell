description: 'In order to try out SIMSOLID, I wanted to compare it to a study previously done using traditional FEA. The model selected was a welded tube joint. This is typical of joints commonly found in industry and from past experience I have found that conventional FEA codes have a difficult time achieving accurate results at stress concentration points, such as at the intersection of the two tube sections in this model.'
