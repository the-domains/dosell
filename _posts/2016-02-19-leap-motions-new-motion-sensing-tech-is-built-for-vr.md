description: "Prior to the Orion, the only headset to have the Leap Motion sensors embedded is Razer's OSVR, and even then it's available just as an optional faceplate. But since the Orion hardware is designed specifically for VR headsets, the hope here is that more hardware manufacturers will be more willing to embed Leap Motion's 3D motion sensors in their AR and VR headsets."
