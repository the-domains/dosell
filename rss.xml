            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What does AI mean for the future of manufacture?</h1><p>The world is on the brink of the fourth industrial revolution, and it could change the way we use everything from cars to shoes. The first three industrial revolutions brought us mechanisation, mass production and automation. Now, more than half a century after the first robots worked on production lines, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are shaking things up again.</p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/spark/social-innovation/factory-supervisor-using-interactive-display-xlarge.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>IoT messaging protocol is big security risk</h1><p>The insecure implementation of the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol, an Oasis standard for IoT communication, by many IoT product vendors is contributing to the high risk of IoT devices on enterprise and home networks. Although TLS is recommended by the Cloud Security Alliance for secure communication with MQTT, most vendors appear to ignore transport security, making all communication open and available.</p><img src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/05/wifi-iot-100722302-large.3x2.jpg"></article>]]></description>
