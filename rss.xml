            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nvidia creates a deep-learning platform for self-driving cars</h1><p>The self-driving car is a huge computational problem. It's so tough that traditional computer vision techniques don't work tackling it. So Nvidia has turned to an artificial intelligence technique, dubbed deep learning, to train brain-like computers that can learn how to identify hazards on a road and safely direct a self-driving car.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b039ac2d3a13e9d573d343a53943d396ddda5090.jpg"></article>]]></description>
