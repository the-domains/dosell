            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Comparing SIMSOLID with a FEA Benchmark</h1><p>In order to try out SIMSOLID, I wanted to compare it to a study previously done using traditional FEA. The model selected was a welded tube joint. This is typical of joints commonly found in industry and from past experience I have found that conventional FEA codes have a difficult time achieving accurate results at stress concentration points, such as at the intersection of the two tube sections in this model.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7e0dabd567ef176edfdc3ec9b07b843561233bdb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
